# Ideal Jobs for the team members are as follows: 

### Amy 
* AI specialisation  

### Ahmed 
* Software Engineer 

### Kaihang 
* Software Programmer  

### Nicholas 
* Financial Advisor  

Leaving aside Nicholas’ Financial Adviser job selection, the ideal jobs from Amy, Ahmed and Kaihang all involve great usage of computer languages to create varying different outcomes focusing on certain fields, however being more specific between a programmer and an engineer is more title based with a focus on programmer generally solving solutions with pre-existing tools/frameworks where as an engineer leans more towards developing those tools/frameworks and software programmes focus on a single stage of the development cycle whereas the engineer see it from start to end.  

AI engineer would focus on the creation of their AI system from start to end using various engineering and programming features at their behest.  

A financial advisor in compatibility to these aforementioned jobs would only use their already given software programmes to help create advice for their clients. 

 

 

# Tools used:

Github a program used to consolidate the teams work onto an online repository system to where it can use its primary function of being a code hosting platform to where the team members can interact within the repository to control and collaborate on the project together leading to the creation of a website.  

Microsoft teams is used as a general communication programme between users of the team be leaving direct messages within the team group chat and coordinating meetings.

# Comments on how well the audit trail on git repository reflects the group’s work. 

# Reflection piece 

## Nicholas –  

Reflecting on the groups performance as a whole, the usage of Microsoft teams and the response time between the members using a rating system out of 10, I would give the group a 2, the reason for this is the extreme lack of responses to the group assignment until the extended due date, which in turn caused me to do the vast majority of the assignment, something I did not plan for and had to cancel other appointments and work to complete. 

What went well: The only thing that went well within the group, was my own work ethic to get the assignment done, constantly attempting to get the group together to begin and get something done, that persistence might be the reason why the assignment was completed.  

What could be improved: The only thing that could be improved would be response time and participation of the other group members outside the twilight hour of submission. 

One surprising feature: The surprising feature throughout the assignment would be the interview with the IT professional as the insightfulness of them and display of the IT industry really opened my eyes to a lot of different variables within the industry that I did not know of. 

One thing learned about groups: As a baseline just attempt to do everything yourself as you might not know if someone else will contribute.  

GitHub as a reflection of the group’s activity shows typesetting done by Amy on the final day, outside of that it does not show group contribution to the actual work being done. 

 

## Amy –  
What could possibly go wrong with a group project?
We have affirmed Murphys Law: Anything that could go wrong, will go wrong. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law
We all have conflicting availablity, work hours, schedules, and are subject to the common psychology of :"diffusion of responsiblity"
https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-diffusion-of-responsibility-2795095
- hoping someone else will tell us what to do (looks over and nods at Nicholas).
There were a few attempts made to get the ball rolling initially, but at that stage, nobody had taken lead, until Nicholas stepped in "In the Nick of Time" and has saved our group project.
Personally, I havent had electricity or internet or hot water for the last week, while I've been in the process of moving house due to a miscommunications with the provider. Everything that could have gone wrong there, also went wrong there.
