 Ideal Jobs for the team members are as followed: 

Amy – Working for Google with their Sentient Robots (AI specialisation)  

Ahmed – Software Engineer 

Kaihang – Software Programmer  

Nicholas – Financial Adviser  

Leaving aside Nicholas’ Financial Adviser job selection, the ideal jobs from Amy, Ahmed and Kaihang all involve great usage of computer languages to create varying different outcomes focusing on certain fields, however being more specific between a programmer and an engineer is more title based with a focus on programmer generally solving solutions with pre-existing tools/frameworks where as an engineer leans more towards developing those tools/frameworks and software programmes focus on a single stage of the development cycle whereas the engineer see it from start to end.  

AI engineer would focus on the creation of their AI system from start to end using various engineering and programming features at their behest.  

A financial advisor in compatibility to these aforementioned jobs would only use their already given software programmes to help create advise for their clients. 

 

 

Tools used  

Github a program used to consolidate the teams work onto an online repository system to where it can use its primary function of being a code hosting platform to where the team members can interact within the repository to control and collaborate on the project together leading to the creation of a website.  

Microsoft teams is used as a general communication programme between users of the team be leaving direct messages within the team group chat and coordinating meetings.
