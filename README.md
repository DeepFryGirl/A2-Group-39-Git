# Ideal Jobs for the team members are as follows: 

### Amy 
* AI specialisation  

### Ahmed 
* Software Engineer 

### Kaihang 
* Software Programmer  

### Nicholas 
* Financial Advisor  

Leaving aside Nicholas’ Financial Adviser job selection, the ideal jobs from Amy, Ahmed and Kaihang all involve great usage of computer languages to create varying different outcomes focusing on certain fields, however being more specific between a programmer and an engineer is more title based with a focus on programmer generally solving solutions with pre-existing tools/frameworks where as an engineer leans more towards developing those tools/frameworks and software programmes focus on a single stage of the development cycle whereas the engineer see it from start to end.  

AI engineer would focus on the creation of their AI system from start to end using various engineering and programming features at their behest.  

A financial advisor in compatibility to these aforementioned jobs would only use their already given software programmes to help create advice for their clients. 

 
# How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers?
## Nicholas - Financial Adviser 
- Employers see a growth of 16.4% in the last year of jobs within the financial industry sector or 2.8% in the last quarter ‘https://labourmarketinsights.gov.au/industries/industry-details?industryCode=K’ in terms of specific demand for this job ‘The NSC produces employment projections to show where likely future job opportunities may be. The latest data are for the five years from November 2021 to November 2026. Over this period, the number of workers: is expected to grow strongly and is likely to reach 68,800 by 2026. (Source: National Skills Commission Employment Projections to 2026.) https://labourmarketinsights.gov.au/our-research/employment-projections/
The job generally gravitates to these two main industries, Financial and Insurance services, or Professional, scientific, and technical services.

## Kaihang - Software Programmer 
– Employers see ap projected change of an increase of 27% which is approximately 42,200 jobs within this specific space for software programmers ‘The NSC produces employment projections to show where likely future job opportunities may be. The latest data are for the five years from November 2021 to November 2026. Over this period, the number of workers: is expected to grow very strongly and is likely to reach 198,400 by 2026. Source: National Skills Commission Employment Projections to 2026. ‘https://labourmarketinsights.gov.au/occupation-profile/software-and-applications-programmers?occupationCode=2613’ 
The job generally gravitates to these two main industries, Professional, scientific, and technical services, or financial and insurance services 

## Ahmed – Software engineer 
– Data for employment outlook for this specific job is located within the software programmer section indicating growth within this field as it is a branch off of the software programmer career path to a more development orientated position one can draw that if software programmer jobs are on the ascending scale that software engineering jobs are also on an uptrend.

## Amy – somewhere in the world of AI 
– As with software engineer, working in AI can also contain more of a focus on data analysis but still stems from software programming however as an even more specialised field it is reasonable to assume that the jobs within this field while limited in scope the jobs within this market will still be on an upward trend due to the amount of software programming jobs are increasing.

<p> Ranking these ideal jobs in terms of demand from employers sees Kaihang’s Software Programmer at the most in demand, Nicholas’ Financial adviser role at second most, whereas Amy and Ahmed in a more specialised version of software programmer with unspecified amounts of job positions and data at a Ahmed third and Amy fourth.

 General skill ranking – Speaking, Active listening, writing, coordination with others, instructing, critical thinking, monitoring, judgement and decision making, complex problem solving, time management, serving others, management of personal resources, management of finite resources, social perceptiveness, reading comprehension.

 # What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set? 

 Three highest ranked IT-specific skill which were not listed in our skill sets are: Microsoft windows, project management and SAP 
What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?

 # Three highest ranked General skills which were not listed in our skill sets are: 
 Troubleshooting, Detail-Orientated and Creativity. 
 
# Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?
Having looked through the Burning Glass data, the opinion on the ideal jobs of the group has not changed, in fact you might say has actually solidified peoples position in what skillsets they need going forward down their respective path and reinforced the need for quality education and experience to gain the kind of skills needed, for example Troubleshooting as a general skill was not listed in the job skillsets however as a reasonable person would know this kind of skill is truly invaluable to have and highly sort after by employers according to the Burning Glass Data and in terms of IT-Specific skills, having good knowledge of a simple product such as Microsoft windows was unexpected to see ranked so highly though a common sense look, as a very highly used program and feature that most human beings on the planet have access to one can make assurances that it is a skill that a person would need to have mastery over to provide a service to others.

# Project Ideas 

 Using the idea from Nicholas, the project idea brought forward will be roughly what was outlined previously 

 
 ## Overview – 
An App that is an aggregate of all the various streaming platforms that you have an active membership on. This App would allow you to search for a piece of media and regardless of what streaming platform it is on, will redirect you including SSO, to that application/media stream with the addition of being able to be used on almost any device and system they come with whether it be for example: apple or android, the application will function for both. The goal here is to be a quality-of-life changer for the multiple users of the application to greatly reduce one’s time and effort of finding a specific piece of media to view, while at the same time give the user multiple options through a recommend page with a list to various streaming platforms of other potential media which are related to the initial query.

## Motivation –
The motivation for this project is one out of frustration of having many streaming platforms to chose from at your fingertips but only to find the current one you’re logged into does not contain the piece of media you were looking to view, so you have to log out and log into another platform and if you’re mistaken again you’ll have to repeat it until you have the correct platform, that takes time which this project application will cut down on drastically and offer positive recommendations of other liked media sources to the original one you were seeking.  Also, a key reason to learn new skills by creating the app in the first place is another motivational point and knowing it will be of service to others.

## Description –
The product being developed is an in-depth piece of search system technology which will solve the problem created by a lack of inter-platform recognition by making it so a user can search various media platforms, this product will be focused on finding a certain piece of media from a varied amount of platforms using the example: The television show Stranger Things, which is broadcasted on the streaming platform Netflix, the program will be able to deliver you to the broadcasters domain of the specified media ‘Stranger Things’ on Netflix and open the program for you, without the need to go through different programs to find that specific piece of media. 
The application will need the following to function correctly and be able to give the most accurate information regarding the searchable data this includes: A database which will be used to store every single piece of media from the various platforms and then use the search function created through programming languages such as Python, to make a directory for the search to acquire the information from the database, which can be put into URL form to give the user a direct link to their destination, in doing so the quality of life of the user is increased to follow up with the different media sources this would then go through a normal networking system by the use of manual input from the user to give them their desired outcome a further example would be just like the Google function of searching a key word and being given links under it, except the main search result will apply to give you the desired media platform and then the additional results will be recommendations of the following key word(s) searched.
Additional search history features as followed; searching through the database on inputs from users, must be a friendly interface that just takes the user exactly where they need to go with no added clutter, can bring up previous request history stored for the person and even mark media as a favourite.
Using different devices, the app will have all if not at least the majority of the major in use systems such as android and apple so the program will be able to function on all devices that the users may have.
The app will also have automatic speech recognition, which is a feature used for those who may have an injury, disability which leaves them unable to use their hands or lack the ability to write therefore they can use their voice to search for the piece of media they need instead. 
Two forms of Data collection and caching, in data collection it will have an opt-out function for those who do not want any of their searches being recorded and given to a third-party as privacy to some of the people who use this app will be a top priority, as this also establishes a form of trust with the person using it knowing that nothing nefarious will happen to their data. Data caching so the app will store as much data as possible so it can be functional even without the internet as going back to a previous search it can tell you where you last found that piece of media instead of automatically opening it for you, just given you a reminder that it is there. 

## Tools –
Tools required to produce a project such as this will involve various different features from GitHub as a form of source-control in combination with fork that is an interface for GitHub, then using a integrated development environment such as visual studio 2022 for the basis of being the IDE to create the code for the application using all kinds of programming languages required for the task for example; Python. You will need access to the different phone systems such as android and apple to make sure the technology you’re creating works on both platforms. 

## Skills – 
The skills required in the previous project idea remain relevant as listed below. 
skills required for this project will involve; Have an understand of programming languages such as Csharp and C++. Interface and database creation which must have significant backend to host the data of the media platforms, easy to use interface such as a cloud system. Find out how to gather information either by user driven APIs or directly sourced from the streaming platforms themselves.
Additional skills required after reviewing the burning glass document to bring more light into the skills area of a project in IT would be critical thinking, judgement and decision making, time management skills, troubleshooting, detail-orientated work, SQL, JavaScript, system analysis, programming and systems evaluation. 

## Outcome – 
If this project is successful, it will create that quality-of-life users of multiple platforms have been looking for as a search function between all the possible locations to view a specific piece of media and give them useful and relative recommendations to view other sources instead of just a rough throw together of possible things you might like to see. The original issue was having either too many places to look or not an option to look with the lack of search functionality and the project is able to overcome this by giving the user the ability to be able to search between all platforms. The key impact areas this will develop is forward thinking going into the future with other programs to have this kind of feature as a baseline and create easier user access to the interface of programs and applications with the simplicity of a google like search bar. 



## Marketability – 
This application should be marketed along side of various streaming platforms within the play shop or apple shop to give users the ability to add this on as an additional feature, while it might look as if the application is driving possible consumers away from a platform, it also does the reverse in bringing people to the platform, using the Strange Things example once more someone who has Stan might use the search and realise that the program they want to watch is on Netflix instead and then that could lead to a Netflix purchase, whereas someone with Netflix might want to watch Billions, which could lead to a Stan purchase, so the net gain is really with all the streaming media platforms. 

 

# Tools used:
